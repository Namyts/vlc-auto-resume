# Namyts's Automatic Bookmark

When a video is paused, this addon will:

1. Create a bookmark.m3u in the folder with the current time
2. Append all future episodes into the m3u playlist (alphabetically)

This means you can just click on bookmark.m3u to resume your video

<br/>

_Designed for shows where all episodes are contained in one folder, are of the same format, and are in the correct order when alphabetised._

Install by placing script inside %appdata%/roaming/vlc/lua/extensions
